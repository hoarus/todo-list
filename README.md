This project is a to-do list.

The purpose of this project is to embed the OOP principles that I have learned into a javascript project. Specifically, I will be practicing:
- The use of Webpack
- Factory Functions
- Classes
- SOLID principles and the Single Responsibility Principle


Plan:

The user will have access to multiple projects.

Each project will have:
- Name
- List of Todos (array of objects)

Each to-do will be an object with:
- Title
- Due Date
- Description
- Priority
- Completion Status (Complete, Pending)


NEXT STEPS:
- Configure 'list project tasks' to accurately set tasks within their container (e.g. to do or complete)
- Create button to decomplete task
- Create button to delete task
- Embed project functionality
